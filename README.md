## Overview
PizzaMe is an online platform that allows users to:
- Register and create a profile
- Search for pizza van locations
- Review the pizza orders
- Pre-register interest in orders for a specific day / location

The platform ensures accessibility across all devices and browsers, and its goal is to streamline the process of buying a pizza. In future iterations, PizzaMe will be updated to have more location options, online pre-ordering and talk to the van via messaging.

## UX - User Experience
### Design Inspiration
My inspiration for PizzaMe came from the colours of Pizza, why change what is already a great formula! 

For the business inspiration, there is a pizza van that visits my area but only on a Tuesday. Unless I ask them, I have no idea where in town they are the rest of the week. What if I need a pizza, like medically NEED a pizza on a Friday?! A website is required!

### Colour Scheme
![Pizza](<planning_files/pizza.png>)
![Tomatoes](<planning_files/tomatoes.jpg>)

|Tag|Colour|Item(s)|Hex Code|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Primary Color:**|Red|Tomato, Pepper|#f20929|
|**Secondary Color:**|Green|Basil, Pepper|#798539|
|**Accent Color:**|Yellow|Cheddar, Motzeralla|#d2913f|
|**Background:**|Brown|Mushrooms|#ad8875|
|**Font Color:**|Black|Olives|#01000|

#### Accessibility check for colour scheme

Colour Blind Safe and contrast was checked by [Adobe Color](<https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility>)

![Contrast Check](<planning_files/ContrastCheck.jpg>)

#### Contrast checker

To check the text contrast I used [Adobe Color](<https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility>)

![Contrast Red Black](<planning_files/Contrast-Red-Black.jpg>)
![Contrast Green Black](<planning_files/Contrast-Green-Black.jpg>)
![Contrast Yellow Black](<planning_files/Contrast-Yellow-Black.jpg>)
![Contrast Brown Black](<planning_files/Contrast-Brown-Black.jpg>)

### Font

Using [Google Font](<https://fonts.google.com/>), I imported "Montserrat" and "Bricolage Grotesque" to my CSS file. I set "Montserrat" as my default font. 
I used "Bricolage Grotesque" as a font for content on my menu page and for authorisation pages.
Aditionally I used "Bodoni Moda" and "Bodoni Moda SC" as highlight fonts.

## Project Planning

### Strategy Plane
The primary objective of PizzaMe is to bridge the gap between people who want pizza and small pizza makers. By offering an intuitive interface, users can easily search for their ideal pizza and pre-order without hassle.

### Site Goals
- Provide customers with a user-friendly platform to book pizzas with PizzaMe.
- Allow PizzaMe to manage their pre-orders and reviews.
- Offer an intuitive interface with role-based dashboards for workers and customers.

### Agile Methodologies - Project Management
I used an agile approach to project management. The PizzaMe development process was broken into sprints, and tasks were added to the GitHub project board to be tracked and managed through issues.

## Security
All data is securely handled with Djangoâ€™s security features, including:
- CSRF protection for form submissions.
- Data encryption for sensitive information like passwords using Django's built-in authentication.
- Role-based access control to restrict sensitive data to authorized users.

Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented using Django's Permission systems. `Customers` and `Admins` are grouped based on their role, and their access to sensitive information is restricted accordingly.  `Admins` have the broadest access for system management through the admin panel. `Customers` can access their own orders through the my_orders page. `Guest/Visitors` can only see the products.

## Pizza Booking System

### Confirmation Messages
- **User Feedback**: Confirmation messages are shown to users when important actions are performed, such as logging in, booking a pizza, editing a pizza or deleting a pizza. These messages help ensure a smooth user experience by providing feedback on successful actions.

### CRUD Functionality
- The user can implement `C U and D` on the `order` pizza page and `R` is implemented on the `my orders` page.

## Features

### **Validation Testing**

All code has been validated through:
- **HTML**: [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- **CSS**: [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
- **Python**: PEP8 validation to ensure code quality inside `VSCode` with `Flake8`
- **Lighthouse**: Validated to below my standards on mobile performance. If I was using a paid plan of Cloudinary and/or Heroku these scores would be better than shown.

- These issues are because of Heroku and Cloudinary being on a free package and thus taking longer than desired for the scanners rankings. The score you get for mobile may be more favourable or less depending on location and time of day. I have attempted to adjust for this impact with Lazyload and other optimisation changes which are reflected in the Desktop score above.

## Deployment

All code for this project was written in Visual Studio as the integrated development environment. GitHub was used for version control, and the application was deployed to Heroku from GitHub with Cloudinary as hosting for the files.

### Pre-Deployment

### Cloudinary - Setting Up
1. Navigate to www.cloudinary.com, and click the Sign Up for Free button. Create a new account.
2. Click on Create Account, and click the link in the verification email that you'll be sent.
3. On the Dashboard, copy the API Environment variable somewhere safe - this must be added to the Heroku
configuration variables in the next section and in your env.py file.

### Heroku Notes

To ensure a successful deployment to Heroku, the following practices are to be followed:

- **Requirements File:** The `requirements.txt` file must be kept up to date to ensure all imported Python modules are configured correctly for Heroku.
- **Procfile:** A `Procfile` was added to configure the application as a Gunicorn web app on Heroku.
- **Allowed Hosts:** In `settings.py`, the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list was configured to include the Heroku app name and `localhost`. Example format:
    ```python
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-app-name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
    ```
- **Environment Variables:** All sensitive data such as the `DATABASE_URL`, `CLOUDINARY_URL`, and `SECRET_KEY` are added to the `.env` file, which is ignored by Git using `.gitignore`. These variables are added to Heroku manually through the Config Vars section.

### Deploying with Heroku

The steps for deploying to Heroku are as follows (Experience from previous Django projects):

1. **Create New App:** Log in to your Heroku account and click on the "Create New App" button.
2. **App Name:** Choose a unique name for your app.
3. **Select Region:** Choose the appropriate region (Europe was selected for this project).
4. **Create App:** Click the "Create App" button to proceed.
5. **Deployment Method:** In the "Deploy" tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
6. **Connect to GitHub:** Search for the repository name and click "Connect".
7. **Manual or Automatic Deployment:** Select either manual or automatic deployment. Ensure the main branch is selected for deployment.
8. **Config Vars:** In the "Settings" tab, click "Reveal Config Vars" and input the required environment variables.
9. **Buildpack:** Select Node.js and Python as the buildpacks for your project.
10. **Deploy:** Once the configuration is complete, click the "Deploy Branch" button. After successful deployment, a "View" button will appear to take you to the live site.

### Fork this Repository

1. Go to the GitHub repository.
2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right-hand corner.

### Clone this Repository

1. Go to the GitHub repository.
2. Click the "Code" button at the top of the page.
3. Choose between 'HTTPS', 'SSH', or 'GitHub CLI' depending on your preference.
4. Click the copy button to copy the URL.
5. Open Git Bash.
6. Change the working directory to where you want to clone the directory.
7. Type:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MathewIsherwood/PizzaVan
    ```
8. Press Enter to create the local clone.

**Note:** The difference between a clone and a fork is that with a clone, you need permission to push changes to the original repository, whereas a fork creates an entirely new project under your GitHub account.

## AI
### Use AI Tools to Assist in Code Creation
AI tools, such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, were utilized to generate code snippets aligned with project requirements. These tools helped streamline the development process by providing suggestions for repetitive tasks, boilerplate code, and complex logic implementations. The generated code was reviewed and adjusted to ensure it met the projectâ€™s standards and functionality. Sometimes my lack of knowledge about code suggested led me down a fruitless hole which I had to revert out of, for example it was suggested I use a counter in **with** by Copilot, but I didn't know that Django templates didn't allow that. On the whole the use of AI was positive for the project.
On a positive note, when my functions and classes were becoming more complicated (my `views.py`) the AI suggestions generally improved my ability to develop changes without hitting errors. 

### Use AI Tools to Assist in Debugging Code
AI tools were employed to identify and resolve bugs efficiently. By analyzing error messages and suggesting potential fixes, these tools reduced debugging time and improved code reliability. Key interventions included resolving syntax errors (missing : ; etc), optimizing database queries, and addressing edge cases. AI also helped clean my code to pass PEP8.

### Use AI Tools to Optimize Code for Performance and User Experience
AI-driven suggestions were used to enhance code performance and improve user experience. This included optimizing database queries, and refining UI/UX elements. The AI recommendations were evaluated and implemented selectively to ensure they aligned with project goals. This helped me not stray too far in the `views.py` and focus on bringing over only the neccesarry data. This was especially helpful in `order_pizza` when the if statements started to build up.

### Use AI Tools to Create Unit Tests
GitHub Copilot was leveraged to generate Django unit tests for key application features in the manual test table. These tests ensured adequate code coverage and validated the functionality of critical components. The generated tests were reviewed and modified as needed to improve accuracy and completeness and then used for manual testing. The good thing about co-writing these with the AI is that it gave me different ideas of what to test than what I had initially put down. Some of the tests it suggested were wrong but I removed them from the pool. AI, whilst being an amazing resource isn't 100% correct at this time.

### Reflect on AIâ€™s Role in the Development Process and Its Impact on Workflow
AI tools significantly enhanced the development workflow by increasing efficiency and reducing repetitive tasks. They provided valuable detailed insights during debugging, optimized performance by removing the unneccsary, and facilitated the creation of robust manual tests. The integration of AI tools allowed me to focus on higher-level problem-solving and innovation, ultimately improving the overall quality of the project. Despite not getting as much finished as I wanted, this was my fault being new at `Django` rather than my use of AI on the project. During the whole project the AI had a variety of different impacts, the major impact was during code creation and debugging. However I did use AI throughout if I wanted to query something or to have something explained.
